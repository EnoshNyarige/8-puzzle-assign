# 8-puzzle-assign
### Implementing the 8-Puzzle problem using A* search algorithm


- The Program takes an input for the START state and GOAL state configurations from the user, interactively. 
- Keep track of the tiles through coordinates(i, j), where i(0, 1, 2) is the row coordinates and j(0, 1, 2) the column coordinates

- *When entering the values of each coordinates, an empty coordinate(empty tile) will have a zero(0)*

### Steps to compile and execute this Program

- ABC
- DEF
